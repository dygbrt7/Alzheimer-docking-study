# Alzheimer Molecular Docking Study

This repository contains molecular docking studies of the Alzheimer's drug Donepezil with both:
- **Target** protein (4EY7 - Acetylcholinesterase)
- **Off-target** protein (to assess selectivity)

## Directory Structure

- `target_docking/` – Docking with Alzheimer's main protein
- `off_target_docking/` – Docking with a possible off-target protein
- `ligands/` – Ligand structures (e.g., donepezil)
- `results/` – Output docking poses and logs

## Requirements

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
